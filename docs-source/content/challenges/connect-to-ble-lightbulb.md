### Challenge 11

See if you can connect the Badge to the BLE Lightbulb on the table in the hacking lounge and change its colours.

This is an advanced task and may involve installing the LED light's mobile app and using the Nordic Semiconductor mobile apps to read changes in the parameters on the light. 

You can get guidance [here](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+and+Bluetooth+Lightbulbs) and [here](https://conoroneill.net/using-puck-js-with-kulight-rgb-bluetooth-lightbulb/) but they may not contain a solution specific to this lightbulb.
