### Challenge 12

Implement a webpage that uses Web Bluetooth with the Puck.js library. Start simple and turn on/off an LED on your badge.

Eventually make it retrieve your last tweet from the Twitter API and then display it on the badge screen.

Lots of information about web Bluetooth and Espruino [here](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Web+Bluetooth).
