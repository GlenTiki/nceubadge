### Challenge 13

This is another advanced challenge. We recommend starting with the [instructions here](https://www.espruino.com/Puck.js+Controlling+Other+Pucks) and then decide if you want to continue.

Also consider the new [BLE mesh networking standard](http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/308148/) which is currently not supported on Espruino but would make for an impressive community contribution.
