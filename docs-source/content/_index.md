# NodeConf EU 2017 Badge

Welcome!

We hope you are as excited as we are about your attendee badge this year. We've spent the past few months designing and preparing it for the event.

## The Badge
The open source hardware badge contains a small but powerful Bluetooth LE module running [Espruino](https://www.espruino.com) software, which is a JavaScript interpreter optimised for low-power devices. On this site, we'll explain the basics of using and programming the badge and even how to add hardware to it.

## Getting Started

In the Getting Started section we give you all the details of:

* Unlocking the badge
* The built-in software features
* Connecting to the badge
* Hello World on the console
* Other code samples to learn from
* The hardware features
* Board prototype area (including the pin-out)

### Your Challenges

We have a large set of challenges for you to get maximum use of the badge and learn lots in the process.

### The Grand Challenge
For a chance to win a ticket to next year’s NodeConf EU 2018, we have a grand challenge. Any attendee can enter. There are no limits on what you can do but it must make use of the Badge. It can be software, hardware or a mix of both. It can involve Bluetooth but doesn’t have to. 

Anyone who wishes to enter must demo their completed entry between 4.30pm and 5pm on Wednesday in the Hacking Lounge to the judges.

The winner will be announced at the Closing Party dinner and on @nearform Twitter on Wednesday night. They and the runners-up will demo what they have created to the crowd.
