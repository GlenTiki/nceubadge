What about:

* Putting LEDs around the corners and using those to show the correct 
patterns. However, due to the way the capacitive sense and LEDs are shared,
you'll only be able to use White and Blue LEDs, not any of the coloured
ones!
* Getting rid of all the callbacks. I've been super lazy - you could probably
tidy things up a lot more using Promises.
* Make a much better game.
* Use the Bluetooth to connect to another Badge and control it
* Interface with a Web Bluetooth Website
* Make a multiplayer game!
