You can add whatever hardware you like to the prototyping area. It's where you'll be connecting extra LEDs, buzzers etc. The column of holes along the board's left edge are connected to pins D0 to D8, Ground and Power. However all of the other holes in that grid are unconnected and can be used to attach your components together.

As always, the [Espruino web-site](https://www.espruino.com/) has lots more info and examples.

## Pin/Hole behaviour
The edge holes and the corner holes each have slightly different capabilities as follows:

###Â Proto pins

* 0 - Digital I/O Only
* 1 - Digital I/O Only
* 2 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
* 3 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
* 4 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
* 5 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
* 6 - Digital I/O Only
* 7 - Digital I/O and Serial TX
* 8 - Digital I/O and Serial RX
 
### Corners

* 1 - Digital I/O Only
* 2 - Digital I/O Only
* 3 - Digital I/O Only
* 4 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
* 5 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
* 6 - Digital I/O and Analogue-in (ADC)
