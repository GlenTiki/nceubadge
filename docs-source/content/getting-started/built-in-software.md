Now that you've unlocked the badge (you'll have to do this any time you remove the battery), you can explore the built in sample apps. Out of the box, your badge has the following:

* Image display cycling
* Selectable menus
* T-Rex who has escaped the Chrome browser
* The world's most awkward on-board REPL
* The greatest game ever written, Asteroids
