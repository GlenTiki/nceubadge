Download it from here\n If your\u0026rsquo;re using Windows 8.1, or 10 you\u0026rsquo;ll need to pair your Badge using the Windows Bluetooth menu before it\u0026rsquo;ll appear in the Web IDE.

	"description": "",
	"content": " This is an Open Source Hardware project. Schematics and board design files are available in the /hardware directory of the repo.\nThe badge uses the same core module as the Puck.js and can run most of the same software.\nHardware Features include:\n nRF52832 SoC - 64MHz ARM Cortex M4, 64kB RAM, 512kB Flash, running the Espruino stack Bluetooth Low Energy Powered by a CR2032 battery which can last up to a week depending on what code you are running Daylight-readable LCD screen 6 input buttons Capacative touch sensors on all 6 corners Prototyping area with 8 CPU pins accessible Holes for LEDs on all 6 corners NFC antenna SWD programming pins  CPU Pins (Vertical line of holes along left hand edge of badge) You write to or read from a pin with:\ndigitalWrite(pin, value); digitalRead(pin);  where pin is one of D0, D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8 (D0 at top) and value is 0 or 1.\nThe firmware has some extra API calls and variables for some of the badge features. You can use them as follows:\nButtons You can use\ndigitalWrite(button, value); digitalRead(button);  where value is 1 or 0 and button is one of BTNA, BTNB, BTNU, BTND, BTNL, BTNR\nLEDs If you add LEDs to the corner holes, you can turn them on/off with\ndigitalWrite(led);  where led is one of LED1, LED2, LED3, LED4, LED5, LED6.\nGraphics In many Espruino examples on the main site, you\u0026rsquo;ll find setup code for different types of screens. That has already been taken care of for you on the badge and you can just access the graphics functions directly. e.g.\ng.clear(); g.drawString(\u0026quot;Hello World\u0026quot;,0,0); g.flip();  Capacative Sense You can read the capacitance (and hence touch) from the 6 corners using\nBadge.capSense(corner);  where corner is one of CORNER1, CORNER2, CORNER3, CORNER4, CORNER5, CORNER6.\nBattery Percentage You can get an estimate of the battery level by calling\nBadge.getBatteryPercentage();  It returns an approximate battery percentage remaining based on a normal CR2032 battery (2.8 - 2.2v).\nSet Screen Contrast You can set the screen contrast with\nBadge.setContrast(c)  where c is a float from 0 to 1\nNFC You can set the URL that the NFC antenna broadcasts to NFC-capable phones by calling\nNRF.nfcURL(\u0026quot;url\u0026quot;)  where URL is something like https://www.nearform.com\nNOTE: If your phone is having difficulty picking up the NFC URL, it is likely that the tuning capacitors on your badge need to be changed to different values. Head on over to the Hacking Lounge to get them replaced or be shown how to do it yourself.\nAdvanced: Flashing updated firmware If you need to flash new firmware to the badge, you must first put it in DFU mode by holding BTNA as you insert the battery and quickly letting go of BTNA. Download the Distribution Packet Zip file containing the new firmware to your phobe and use nRF Toolbox on either Android or iOS to send it to the badge.\n"

	"content": " NodeConf EU 2017 Badge Welcome!\nWe hope you are as excited as we are about your attendee badge this year. We\u0026rsquo;ve spent the past few months designing and preparing it for the event.\nThe Badge The open source hardware badge contains a small but powerful Bluetooth LE module running Espruino software, which is a JavaScript interpreter optimised for low-power devices. On this site, we\u0026rsquo;ll explain the basics of using and programming the badge and even how to add hardware to it.\nGetting Started In the Getting Started section we give you all the details of:\n Unlocking the badge The built-in software features Connecting to the badge Hello World on the console Other code samples to learn from The hardware features Board prototype area (including the pin-out)  Your Challenges We have a large set of challenges for you to get maximum use of the badge and learn lots in the process.\nThe Grand Challenge For a chance to win a ticket to next year’s NodeConf EU 2018, we have a grand challenge. Any attendee can enter. There are no limits on what you can do but it must make use of the Badge. It can be software, hardware or a mix of both. It can involve Bluetooth but doesn’t have to.\nAnyone who wishes to enter must demo their completed entry between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday in the Hacking Lounge to the judges.\nThe winner will be announced at the Closing Party dinner and on @nearform Twitter on Wednesday night. They and the runners-up will demo what they have created to the crowd.\n"
