      <description>Challenge 1 This challenge is just to get you warmed up and comfortable using the Web IDE. See if you can display &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; on the badge&amp;rsquo;s screen.
Check out the Espruino site to see what you can do with Graphics and Fonts.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to your badge&amp;rsquo;s software than you realise. Try this:

      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve unlocked the badge (you&amp;rsquo;ll have to do this any time you remove the battery), you can explore the built in sample apps. Out of the box, your badge has the following:
 Your name pre-flashed into the firmware Image display cycling Selectable menus T-Rex who has escaped the Chrome browser Flappy Bird The world&amp;rsquo;s most awkward on-board REPL Etch-a-sketch  Source code for all of these is of course in the Github Repo.</description>

      <title>Detect Button Press</title>
      <link>http://nodeconfeubadge.org/challenges/detect-button-press/</link>

      <guid>http://nodeconfeubadge.org/challenges/detect-button-press/</guid>
      <description>Challenge 2 Reading the instantaneous value of a button is easy (see the getting started docs) but how do you deal with debouncing so it&amp;rsquo;s reliable?
What about more than one button being pressed at the same time?
Help is at hand on the Espruino site.
Buttons are a great example of how you write event-driven code with Espruino rather than the more traditional read-loops that people starting on Arduino tend to use.</description>

      <title>Detect Capacitive Touch</title>

      <guid>http://nodeconfeubadge.org/challenges/detect-capacitive-touch/</guid>
      <description>Challenge 3 It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to read a capacitance value from the 6 lanyard holes in the badge. Experiment with the code and how the badge responds to touch. Then come up with a use for it. Perhaps related to LEDs on the on-screen display?
See the getting started area for the relevant API call.</description>

      <guid>http://nodeconfeubadge.org/challenges/flash-leds/</guid>
      <description>Challenge 4 It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to add LEDs to the 6 corners of your badge. In fact you probably don&amp;rsquo;t even have to solder them. Just stick them in with the short leg oriented to the squared off side of each white circle.
Then try turning them on and off (hint: check the getting started pages). How about some timer-based patterns too? Or controlling them with the buttons?
Note: The low-power nature of the badge means that if you light all LEDs together they&amp;rsquo;ll be quite dim and you&amp;rsquo;ll burn through the battery much more quickly.</description>

      <description>Any modern computer with Bluetooth 4+ should be able to connect to the badge as follows:
Make your badge connectable  Enter the Konami code, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A. Select &amp;ldquo;Make badge connectable&amp;rdquo; in the menu Note the Badge ID  Mac Web Bluetooth on Chrome should just work if your Chrome is up to date. So simply go to the Web IDE here.</description>

      <description>Challenge 5 We have lots of buzzers at the Hacking Station. You just have to solder the red wire to one of the D0-D8 holes on the edge of the badge and the black wire to one of the Ground (-) holes.
Then impress everyone with your groovy tunes using the APIs here.</description>

      <guid>http://nodeconfeubadge.org/getting-started/hello-world-console/</guid>
      <description>Of course we start with Hello World. Follow the connection instructions, then click on the left hand side of the IDE and type:
console.log(&amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;);  Now stop and think for a minute about what just happened there in terms of communications flow.
You should try out other aspects of the Web IDE. It has full auto-complete in the REPL window including Button/LED names and functions.
You could also try the built-in Blockly graphical editor which is very similar to Scratch.</description>

      <description>Challenge 6 If you implement an on-screen menu with up-down-left-right-select then you could have lots of your challenges on the badge at the same time and demo them to people. Have a look at the github repo for the sample code.</description>

      <description>There are three places you can find code to learn from and use:
 The Badge repo The main Espruino site The Puck.js area of the Espruino site  Badge Repo Code The pre-installed main.js code is a treasure trove of useful snippets. Note however that it&amp;rsquo;s too big to be uploaded in its entirety via the Web IDE.

      <description>This is an Open Source Hardware project. Schematics and board design files are available in the /hardware directory of the repo.
The badge uses the same core module as the Puck.js and can run most of the same software.
Hardware Features include:
 nRF52832 SoC - 64MHz ARM Cortex M4, 64kB RAM, 512kB Flash, running the Espruino stack Bluetooth Low Energy Powered by a CR2032 battery which can last up to a week depending on what code you are running Daylight-readable LCD screen 6 input buttons Capacitive touch sensors on all 6 corners Prototyping area with 8 CPU pins accessible Holes for LEDs on all 6 corners NFC antenna SWD programming pins  CPU Pins (Vertical line of holes along left hand edge of badge) You write to or read from a pin with:</description>

      <description>Challenge 8 Broadcast a URL over Bluetooth LE using Eddystone and/or iBeacon and pick it up on your phone (Android for Eddystone, iPhone for iBeacon).
You&amp;rsquo;ll get lots of guidance on the Puck.js site here for Eddystone and here for iBeacon.</description>

      <description>You can add whatever hardware you like to the prototyping area. It&amp;rsquo;s where you&amp;rsquo;ll be connecting extra LEDs, buzzers etc. The column of holes along the board&amp;rsquo;s left edge are connected to pins D0 to D8, Ground and Power. However all of the other holes are unconnected and can be used to attach your components together.
As always, the Espruino web-site has lots more info and examples.
This image shows the basic board setup:</description>

      <description>Challenge 10 HID means Human Interface Device and it&amp;rsquo;s a standard for connecting Bluetooth input devices like keyboards and mice to computers. Your badge can act as a HID button for your laptop including multimedia keys. You could even use it as a clicker for your talk at NodeConf!
Check out the instructions here and try it out for yourself.
Note: Bluetooth HID can&amp;rsquo;t be enabled on an active connection.</description>

      <description>Challenge 11 See if you can connect the Badge to the BLE Lightbulb on the table in the hacking lounge and change its colours.
This is an advanced task and may involve installing the LED light&amp;rsquo;s mobile app and using the Nordic Semiconductor mobile apps to read changes in the parameters on the light.
You can get guidance here and here but they may not contain a solution specific to this lightbulb.</description>

      <description>Challenge 12 See if you can connect the Badge to the BLE LED Strip on the table in the hacking lounge and change its colours.
This is a very advanced task and may involve installing the LED strip&amp;rsquo;s mobile app and using the Nordic Semiconductor mobile apps to read changes in the parameters on the strip.
You can get guidance here and here but they do not contain a solution specific to this strip.</description>

      <description>Challenge 13 This is another advanced challenge. We recommend starting with the instructions here and then decide if you want to continue.
Also consider the new BLE mesh networking standard which is currently not supported on Espruino but would make for an impressive community contribution.</description>

      <description>Challenge 15 You can see hat we took all of your names and turned them into images that were included as part of the software of each badge. A different image for every badge. Your challenge is to do something similar. Find an image somewhere, convert it into the correct format and display it on the badge. You&amp;rsquo;ll have lots of fun with Imagemagick outputting blank images or inverted ones :-)</description>

      <description>Challenge 17 We have a small number of PIR sensors at the Hacking Table. You can easily wire one of them up to your badge so it can detect motion. Now think of ways you could use that at an event.
You can get started with the code here.</description>

      <description>Challenge 18 If you can get your hands on some other BLE device like a Garmin, Fitbit or Milestone, see if you can figure out the protocol.
If you figure it out, write a blogpost about it!
Some of these devices may require registering on the relevant developer sites. However we may have some other Bluetooth devices on the Hacking Table which are easier to communicate with.</description>
