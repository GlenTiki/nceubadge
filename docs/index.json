Select \u0026ldquo;Make badge connectable\u0026rdquo; in the menu Note the Badge ID  Mac Web Bluetooth on Chrome should just work if your Chrome is up to date. So simply go to the Web IDE here. Then:\n Click the connect icon in the top left corner Select the Web Bluetooth option If more than one badge is listed, select your badge ID Click Pair A few seconds later you\u0026rsquo;ll have a REPL running and you can run JS directly on your badge over Bluetooth!  Windows The easiest option is to install the standalone Electron-based Espruino IDE. Download it from here\n If your\u0026rsquo;re using Windows 8.1, or 10 you\u0026rsquo;ll need to pair your Badge using the Windows Bluetooth menu before it\u0026rsquo;ll appear in the Web IDE. (Any time you remove the badge battery, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to remove the Badge from the list of paired devices in Windows and re-pair) Run the IDE Click the connect icon in the top left corner Select the Web Bluetooth option If more than one badge is listed, select your badge ID Click Pair A few seconds later you\u0026rsquo;ll have a REPL running and you can run JS directly on your badge over Bluetooth!  Linux / iOS / Android  See instructions here  More setup (and general) information is available on the Puck.js site if you get stuck. Most, but not all, of the information applies to the badge.\n"

Any attendee can enter. There are no limits on what you can do but it must make use of the Badge. It can be software, hardware or a mix of both. It can involve Bluetooth but doesn’t have to.\nAnyone who wishes to enter must demo their completed entry between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday in the Hacking Lounge to the judges.\nThe winner will be announced at the Closing Party dinner and on @nearform Twitter on Wednesday night. They and the runners-up will demo what they have created to the crowd.\n"
